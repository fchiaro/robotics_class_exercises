# Publisher-subscriber exercise

Implement a publisher that simulates a set of sensors for encoder readings (position of 6 joints) and a subscriber that simulates a set of controllers that prints such readings to stdout.

Encoder reading are represented with `Reading` messages from the `encoder_pubsub_msgs` package.
